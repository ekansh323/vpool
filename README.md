# VIT Carpool - ViPool

ViPool is a student‑built carpooling app made for VIT students to find and share rides between campus, railway stations, and airports.

The idea came from a common problem many VIT students face, finding reliable people to travel with during holidays. ViPool makes it easier for students to connect with each other for shared rides in a simple and safe way.

- Allows others to search and filter rides by route and date<br>
- Riders can request to join a ride<br>
- Ride owners can approve or reject requests<br>
- Seats update automatically<br>

ViPool was built as a real‑world learning project based on personal experience, not just as a college assignment. The focus was on solving a practical problem with clean UI, simple logic, and secure backend rules.
