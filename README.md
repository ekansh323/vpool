# vit_carpool (ViPool)

My first real Flutter project.

## ViPool

ViPool is a student‑built carpooling app made for VIT students to find and share rides between campus, railway stations, and airports.

The idea came from a common problem many vit students face, finding reliable people to travel with during holidays. ViPool makes it easier for students to connect with each other for shared rides in a simple and safe way.

## What ViPool does
Lets students post carpool rides
Allows others to search and filter rides by route and date
Riders can request to join a ride
Ride owners can approve or reject requests
Seats update automatically
Contact between riders happens via WhatsApp
Includes a basic profile section with ride stats
## Tech Stack

## Disclaimer
ViPool does not verify rides or users beyond VIT email authentication.

## Feedback
Feedback, suggestions, and bug reports are welcome.

## About the Project
ViPool was built as a real‑world learning project based on personal experience, not just as a college assignment. The focus was on solving a practical problem with clean UI, simple logic, and secure backend rules.
